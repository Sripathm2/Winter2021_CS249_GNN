# UCLA Winter 2019 CS 249: Graph Neural Networks (GNN)


In this course, each student will 1) present one GNN-related paper; 2) finish the course project with group. 

This Github repo is the place each student submit their report and code for both *Paper Presentation* and *Course Project*.

For Paper Presentation, the presenter should upload the following files to each given folder:

- *Report*: briefly summarize the paper. It should be structured as an [academic review](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2021/ReviewerGuide), including introduction, related work, solution, experimental results, major conclusions, pros and cons. 
- *Demo*: an interactive Jupyter Notebook / Colab to show visualize the result of the paper. For most paper, it's highly recommended that you download the source code of the paper, running the main model and see the results or visualization in this notebook.
- *Slides*: which you use to present at the course. It should contain both the contents of the report and some key results of the code demo.
- *Quiz*: 3 questions about this paper. Use xxx to generate the quiz link, provide automatic gradings and feedback.

Every audience should participate in Q&A after the presentation, and finish the quiz using the quiz link after the course.

For Course Project, each group can firstly create their own github code repo, and then create a subfolder under Course_Project, submit their slides and Github code link under it.
